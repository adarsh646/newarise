# 🔗 Link AI-Generated Workouts with Trainer-Added Workout Details

## 📋 Overview
This PR implements a seamless integration between AI-generated workout plans and trainer-added workout details. When users click on an exercise in their AI workout plan (e.g., "Squat"), they are now redirected to a detailed workout screen that displays comprehensive information from the trainer's workout database.

## ✨ What's New

### 🎯 Key Features

#### 1. **New Workout Detail Screen** (`workout_detail.dart`)
- Created a dedicated screen to display detailed workout information
- Fetches workout data from the `trainer_workouts` Firestore collection
- Implements intelligent workout matching:
  - **Exact name match**: First attempts to find workouts with exact name matches
  - **Case-insensitive search**: Falls back to case-insensitive matching
  - **Alias support**: Checks workout aliases for alternative exercise names
- Displays comprehensive workout information:
  - Exercise GIF/animation
  - Target muscle groups
  - Required equipment
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Pro tips
  - Safety warnings

#### 2. **Enhanced Workout Plan Display** (`workout_plan_display.dart`)
- Added clickable exercise names in the AI workout plan
- Integrated navigation to the new `WorkoutDetailScreen`
- Passes exercise name as a parameter for dynamic content loading
- Maintains existing features:
  - Progress tracking
  - Exercise completion checkboxes
  - Timer functionality
  - Week-by-week progression

#### 3. **Graceful Fallback Handling**
When a workout is not found in the trainer database:
- Displays a user-friendly fallback message
- Shows placeholder image with "No GIF available" indicator
- Informs users: *"Detailed trainer instructions are not available for this exercise yet. Try checking back later."*
- Maintains consistent UI/UX even without data

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

  - Text-to-Speech (TTS) for instructions and warnings
  - Real-time workout tracking

- **Information Architecture**:
  - Clear section headers (Instructions, Tips)
  - Readable typography with proper spacing
  - Warning banners for safety precautions
  - Scrollable content for long instructions

#### Workout Plan Integration:
- **Clickable Exercise Names**: Users can tap any exercise name to view details
- **Visual Feedback**: Exercise names are styled to indicate they're interactive
- **Seamless Navigation**: Smooth transitions between plan view and detail view
- **Context Preservation**: Users can easily return to their workout plan

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```
AI Workout Plan → Exercise Name → Firestore Query → Workout Details
                                        ↓
                                  Not Found?
                                        ↓
                                Fallback Content
```

### Firestore Integration
- **Collection**: `trainer_workouts`
- **Query Strategy**:
  1. Exact match on `name` field
  2. Case-insensitive scan (limited to 25 docs for performance)
  3. Alias matching for exercise variations
- **Fields Used**:
  - `name`: Exercise name
  - `instructions`: Step-by-step guide
  - `gifUrl` / `gif`: Animation URL
  - `tips`: Pro tips for better form
  - `target` / `muscle`: Target muscle group
  - `equipment`: Required equipment
  - `warning`: Safety warnings
  - `aliases`: Alternative names

### Code Structure
```dart
// workout_plan_display.dart (Line 830-838)
GestureDetector(
  onTap: () {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (_) => WorkoutDetailScreen(exerciseName: name.toString()),
      ),
    );
  },
  child: Text(name.toString(), ...),
)
```

```dart
// workout_detail.dart (Line 11-41)
Future<Map<String, dynamic>?> _fetchTrainerWorkout() async {
  // 1) Try exact name match
  // 2) Try case-insensitive by scanning
  // 3) Check aliases
  // 4) Return null if not found
}
```
