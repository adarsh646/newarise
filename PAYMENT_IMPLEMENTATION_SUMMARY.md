## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Payment Failed" | Check Razorpay API key, ensure internet connection |
| Trainer not moving to "Your Trainers" | Check Firestore security rules allow writes |
| "Follow" button disabled | Check user is authenticated |
| Razorpay gateway won't open | Verify API key is valid and active |
| Payment saved but UI not updated | Check Firestore user_payments collection exists |
