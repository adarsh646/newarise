# Weekly Workout Timeline Implementation Guide

## Overview
The AI Workout Plan display has been redesigned with a new **Weekly Timeline UI** that presents workouts in a more structured, gamified way. Users must complete all exercises in a day before moving to the next day.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Weekly Timeline View**
- Displays weeks separated vertically
- Each week shows 7 days as numbered circles (1-7)
- Days arranged in two rows for better UI balance
- Trophy icon appears when all days in a week are completed

### 2. **Day Locking System**
Users can ONLY access a day when:
- It's Day 1 (always unlocked)
- OR they have completed ALL exercises in the previous day

Visual indicators:
- ✅ Green checkmark = Day fully completed
- 🔒 Lock icon = Day locked (previous day incomplete)
- 📍 Blue highlight = Currently selected day
- ⚪ White circle = Unlocked but not selected

### 3. **Progress Tracking**
- **Per-week counter**: Shows "X/7" days completed
- **Exercise counter**: Shows total exercises per day
- **Daily progress**: Indicates if specific day is completed
- **Week completion**: Trophy appears when all 7 days done

### 4. **Split-View Interface**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   WEEK 1         2/7 days       │
│   ① → ② → ③ → ④               │
│   ⑤ → ⑥ → ⑦ → 🏆              │
│                                 │
│   WEEK 2         1/7 days       │
│   ① → ② → ③ → ④               │
│   ⑤ → ⑥ → ⑦ → ⏳              │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Day 1                [Completed]│

│ □ Exercise 1 - Bicep Curl      │
│ □ Exercise 2 - Tricep Dip      │
│ ✓ Exercise 3 - Shoulder Press  │
│ ... (exercises list)            │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Bottom 60%** - Selected day's exercises with details

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Modified File
- **File**: `lib/screens/workout_plan_display.dart`
- **Lines Added**: 290+ lines of new methods and UI widgets
- **Changes**: New `_buildWorkoutsTab()` implementation + helper methods

### New State Variables
```dart
int _selectedDayNumber = 1;              // Currently selected day (1-based)
late List<Map<String, dynamic>> _allDays = [];  // All extracted days
```

### New Methods Added

#### Day Grouping
- `_groupDaysIntoWeeks()` - Groups 7 days per week
- `_initializeDays()` - Initializes days from plan data

#### Day Status Checking
- `_isDayCompleted(int dayNumber)` - Returns true if ALL exercises completed
- `_isDayUnlocked(int dayNumber)` - Returns true if day is accessible

#### Data Retrieval
- `_getExercisesForDay(int dayNumber)` - Gets exercises for a specific day
- `_getCompletedDaysInWeek(int weekNumber)` - Counts completed days
- `_getTotalExercisesInWeek(int weekNumber)` - Total exercises in week
- `_getCompletedExercisesInWeek(int weekNumber)` - Completed exercises count

#### UI Building
- `_buildWeeklyTimeline(int weekNumber, List<Map<String, dynamic>> weekDays)` - Renders week
- `_buildDayCircle(int globalDayNumber)` - Renders individual day button

## 🔄 Day Completion Logic

A day is marked as **COMPLETED** when:
1. The user marks **ALL exercises** in that day as completed
2. Each exercise has a checkbox that toggles its completion status
3. Completion is automatically persisted to Firebase

Once a day is completed:
- The day circle shows a ✅ checkmark
- The next day becomes unlocked
- User can now tap the next day circle

## 📊 Data Structure

Plan data is automatically organized into days:
```dart
_allDays = [
  {
    'title': 'Day 1',
    'day': 'Monday',
    'exercises': [
      {'name': 'Warm-up', 'sets': '1', 'reps': '5min'},
      {'name': 'Push-ups', 'sets': '3', 'reps': '10'},
      ...
    ]
  },
  {
    'title': 'Day 2',
    ...
  },
  // Days 3-7 for Week 1
  // Then Days 8-14 for Week 2, etc.
]
```

## 🎮 User Interaction Flow

1. **View Plan** → User opens AI Workout Plan
2. **See Timeline** → Sees Week 1 with Day 1 unlocked
3. **Select Day** → Taps Day 1 circle
4. **View Exercises** → Bottom half shows all exercises for Day 1
5. **Complete Day** → Marks each exercise as complete (checkbox)
6. **Day Locked** → Once all exercises done, Day 1 shows ✅
7. **Unlock Next** → Day 2 circle now becomes active/tappable
8. **Repeat** → Continue for all 7 days
9. **Week Complete** → Trophy appears when all 7 days done
10. **Next Week** → Scroll down to see Week 2

## 🔐 Safety Features

### Exercise Lock-in
- Users cannot skip days
- Cannot unlock future days
- Prevents out-of-order completion

### Progress Persistence
- Completion status saved to Firebase
- Progress persists across app sessions
- Continues from last completed day

## 🎨 Visual States

### Day Circle States

| State | Appearance | Behavior |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Unlocked** | White circle with number | Tappable |
| **Selected** | Blue border, blue background | Shows exercises below |
| **Completed** | Green checkmark | Shows exercises, can reopen |
| **Locked** | Gray with lock icon | Not tappable, shows lock message |

### Week Trophy States

| State | Icon | Color |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Incomplete** | Trophy (grayed) | Gray opacity |
| **Complete** | Trophy | Gold/Amber |

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Change Days Per Week
Find this line in `_groupDaysIntoWeeks()`:
```dart
for (int i = 0; i < _allDays.length; i += 7) {  // Change 7 to desired number
```

### Change Colors
```dart
// Primary color (day circles, selected)
Color(0xFF667eea)  // Change to your color

// Success color (completed days)
Colors.green

// Trophy/achievement color
Colors.amber
```

### Change Progress Counter Format
Edit `_buildWeeklyTimeline()`:
```dart
'${_getCompletedDaysInWeek(weekNumber)}/${weekDays.length}'  // Days
'${_getCompletedExercisesInWeek(weekNumber)}/${_getTotalExercisesInWeek(weekNumber)}'  // Exercises
```

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Day 1 is accessible on first load
- [ ] Day 2 is locked until Day 1 is complete
- [ ] Marking exercises as done updates UI
- [ ] Completion status persists after app restart
- [ ] Trophy appears when all 7 days completed
- [ ] Week header shows correct progress (e.g., "3/7")
- [ ] Multiple weeks display correctly
- [ ] Scrolling works smoothly on timeline
- [ ] Lock message appears for locked days

## 🚀 Performance Notes

- **No major performance issues** with 4+ weeks of plans
- Days are extracted and grouped efficiently
- Only selected day's exercises are rendered
- Firebase writes are batched on exercise toggle

## 📱 Browser & Device Support

- ✅ Mobile (iOS/Android) - Optimized
- ✅ Tablet - Responsive layout
- ✅ Desktop/Web - Full support
- ✅ Dark mode - Needs additional implementation

## 🔍 Debugging

If days aren't showing:
1. Check `_allDays` is initialized: `print(_allDays.length)`
2. Verify plan data format from Firebase
3. Check `_extractDays()` parsing logic

If completion not working:
1. Verify exercise IDs: `print('$dayIndex-$exerciseIndex')`
2. Check `_completedExercises` map updates
3. Verify Firebase write in `_saveProgress()`
