# Progress Persistence Bug Fix

## Issue Description
After completing exercises in Day 1, when navigating to Day 2, the exercises appeared as incomplete (checkmarks disappeared). The progress was not persisting between days.

## Root Cause
**Location:** `lib/screens/workout_plan_display.dart` - Line 200 in `_maybeCompleteWeek()` method

The bug was in this code:
```dart
void _maybeCompleteWeek() {
  // ... code that detects when all exercises in a plan are complete ...
  
  if (completedCount >= total) {
    if (_completedWeeks < _totalWeeks) {
      setState(() {
        _completedWeeks += 1;
        _completedExercises.clear();  // ❌ THIS WAS THE BUG!
      });
      _saveProgress();  // Saved empty map to Firebase
    }
  }
}
```

### Why This Was Wrong
1. When all exercises were marked complete, `_completedExercises.clear()` would wipe out **ALL** completion data
2. This empty state was then saved to Firebase via `_saveProgress()`
3. When user navigated to Day 2, or reloaded the app, the progress loaded from Firebase showed NO completed exercises
4. Result: All exercises appeared unchecked, appearing as if the user had never completed anything

## Solution Applied
Removed the `.clear()` call entirely. Exercise completion records should **persist across all days** - they should never be erased.

```dart
void _maybeCompleteWeek() {
  // ... code that detects when all exercises in a plan are complete ...
  
  if (completedCount >= total) {
    if (_completedWeeks < _totalWeeks) {
      setState(() {
        _completedWeeks += 1;
        // ✅ REMOVED: _completedExercises.clear();
        // Progress should persist across all days - don't erase it!
      });
      _saveProgress();  // Saves preserved completion records
    }
  }
}
```

## How Progress Persistence Works

### Data Structure
- **`_completedExercises`**: Map<String, bool>
  - Key format: `"<dayIndex>-<exerciseIndex>"` (e.g., "0-0", "0-1", "1-2")
  - Value: `true` if exercise is completed, `false` otherwise
  - Example: `{"0-0": true, "0-1": true, "0-2": false, "1-0": true}`

### Persistence Flow

1. **User marks exercise complete:**
   ```dart
   _completedExercises[exerciseId] = !isCompleted;  // Toggle
   _saveProgress();  // Save to Firebase
   ```

2. **Saving to Firebase:**
   ```dart
   collection: 'plan_progress'
   doc: userId
   collection: 'plans'
   doc: planId
   data: {
     'completedExercises': {...},  // All exercise completion data
     'completedWeeks': 1,
     'updatedAt': serverTimestamp()
   }
   ```

3. **Loading from Firebase:**
   ```dart
   _loadProgress() {
     // Fetches from Firebase and restores _completedExercises map
     // This happens in initState() when screen first loads
   }
   ```

4. **Navigating between days:**
   - When user taps a different day, `_selectedDayNumber` changes
   - The UI rebuilds but `_completedExercises` map remains in memory
   - All previously completed exercises retain their checkmarks

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing Steps
1. ✅ Complete Day 1 exercises (mark at least 3-4 with checkmarks)
2. ✅ Verify "Completed" badge appears on Day 1 header
3. ✅ Click on Day 2 (should now be unlocked)
4. ✅ Go back to Day 1 - exercises should still show checkmarks
5. ✅ Close and reopen the app
6. ✅ Navigate to workout plan - Day 1 exercises should still be checked

### Expected Behavior After Fix
- ✅ Exercise completion persists when switching between days
- ✅ Completion persists across app restarts
- ✅ "Completed" badge shows correctly on completed days
- ✅ Day-by-day progression locking still works (can't unlock Day 3 until Day 2 is complete)

## Technical Details

### Exercise ID Generation
- Format: `"{dayIndex}-{exerciseIndex}"`
- `dayIndex` is 0-based: Day 1 = 0, Day 2 = 1, etc.
- Exercise index is 0-based within each day
- Example:
  - Day 1, Exercise 1: `"0-0"`
  - Day 1, Exercise 2: `"0-1"`
  - Day 2, Exercise 1: `"1-0"`

### Day Completion Logic
```dart
bool _isDayCompleted(int globalDayNumber) {
  final dayIndex = globalDayNumber - 1;
  final exercises = _allDays[dayIndex]['exercises'];
  
  // ALL exercises must be completed
  for (int i = 0; i < exercises.length; i++) {
    final exerciseId = '$dayIndex-$i';
    if (!_completedExercises[exerciseId]) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

## Impact
✅ **High Priority Fix** - Addresses data persistence critical to user experience
- Users can now reliably see their workout progress
- Gamification features (trophies, badges, day unlocking) now work correctly
- Progress survives app restarts
