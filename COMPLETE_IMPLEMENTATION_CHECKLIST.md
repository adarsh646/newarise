## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "Red underlines in trainer_section.dart"
**Solution**: 
```bash
flutter pub get
# Then restart your IDE
```

### Problem: "Razorpay not initializing"
**Solution**: Check API key is correct
```dart
'key': 'rzp_live_YOUR_KEY', // Make sure it matches Razorpay dashboard
```

### Problem: "Payment opens but crashes"
**Solution**: Verify Razorpay key is not null
- Check if key is properly set
- Ensure single quotes around key
- Verify no typos

### Problem: "Payment succeeds but data not saved"
**Solution**: Check Firestore Security Rules
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules
2. Verify `user_payments` collection rules exist
3. Click "Publish" if modified
4. Check collection actually exists

### Problem: "Trainer not moving to 'Your Trainers' after payment"
**Solution**: 
1. Check Firestore `user_payments` collection has the payment record
2. Verify `userId` and `trainerId` fields are correct
3. Restart the app to trigger StreamBuilder refresh
4. Check console for any errors

### Problem: "App crashes on payment error"
**Solution**: Ensure error handlers are implemented
```dart
_razorpay.on(Razorpay.EVENT_PAYMENT_ERROR, _handlePaymentError);
```
