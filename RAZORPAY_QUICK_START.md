## ⚠️ Important Warnings

1. **DO NOT commit test keys to version control**
   - Use environment variables in production
   - Keep API keys in `.env` or backend

2. **Update Firestore Rules BEFORE testing**
   - Without rules, payments won't save
   - Old rules might block the new collection

3. **Test with test key first**
   - Use `rzp_test_xxxxx` for development
   - Switch to `rzp_live_xxxxx` for production

---

## 🆘 Common Issues & Fixes

### ❌ "Razorpay payment not opening"
**Fix**: Check if API key is correct
```dart
'key': 'rzp_live_YOUR_KEY_HERE', // Make sure it starts with rzp_live_ or rzp_test_
```

### ❌ "Payment saved but trainer not in 'Your Trainers'"
**Fix**: Update Firestore Security Rules (see Step 4)

### ❌ "No internet connection error"
**Fix**: Ensure:
- Device has internet
- Firebase is initialized
- No firewall blocking

### ❌ "'trainer_section.dart' has red underlines"
**Fix**: Run `flutter pub get` and restart IDE

### ❌ "App crashes on payment click"
**Fix**: Check that `_razorpay` is initialized in `initState()`
